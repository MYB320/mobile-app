## Introduction

This mobile app is built using the Create Expo Stack and leverages Tamagui for the user interface. The app uses Expo Router for navigation and fetches data from FakestoreAPI to provide users with a shopping experience.

## Features

- **Expo**: Streamlined development workflow.
- **Create Expo Stack**: Integrated setup for Expo projects.
- **Tamagui**: Flexible and performant UI components.
- **Expo Router**: Simple and powerful navigation solution.
- **FakestoreAPI**: Provides mock data for e-commerce functionalities.
